**Cargo Connect** is an express cargo delivery platform designed to transport a wide variety of goods including perishable, fragile, temperature-sensitive items, general cargo, luggage, heavy machinery, construction materials, medical supplies, and airport luggage. Inspired by Uber’s on-demand model, it connects farmers, miners, businesses, and individuals with nearby transporters for seamless, real-time delivery and tracking — all with special care where needed.
